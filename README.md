# odin-landing-page

As the title of the project probably implies on first impression, the goal of this project is to test my understanding of html and css in making a website 
with a pleasing and fundamentally sound design process.

A website is useless without its subject so the idea of the project is a work in progress but I will state some ideas that I think might be nice.

1. Dinosaurs (with the subject of you being able to order your own dinosaur, it isn't true but why not be wacky with it)

2. Pixel art (haven't brainstormed into it as much yet)

3. Anime ( I have been playing Genshin Impact recently so I thought maybe a mock-up of a guide website for characters would be interesting)

and so on and so forth...
